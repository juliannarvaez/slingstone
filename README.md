## Problem Statement 
Museum exhibitions, product demos, and other presentations use digital 3D models to display objects when in-person interaction is not feasible. The traditional methods for orienting the digital object use a mouse or trackpad. While readily available, these products disrupt the user experience as they feel unnatural to operate. There is a gap in technology available today for a product that the user can operate intuitively, in particular, a handheld device that the user can orient to rotate the 3d model in real time.

## Approach Description
We will build a device that will produce a more natural, intuitive user experience by mapping the orientation of a physical, handheld sensor to the 3D virtual object. A commercially-available multi-axis sensor will provide data on the orientation of the device. This data will be fed to the object display system, which will display the virtual object at the same orientation. The sensor will be embedded in housing that will protect from damage and fit into the userâ€™s hand. This sensor bitstream will be fed into a javascript enabled website to provide users with an easily transferable and multi-platform software tool to visualize their 3D models.

## Solution Benefits Description
Users will be able to display and manipulate a 3D object using a single hand and while moving freely. This is advantageous over the most common alternatives, where a click and drag method disrupts flow of presentation. Virtual presentations can be carried out remotely with users being able to devote their attention to their audience instead of controlling their model.

## Existing Competition
Computer mice have been developed with the intention of manipulating models more easily; in particular, 3Dconnexion produces a range of mice optimized for 3d navigation. Additionally, certain console gaming controllers offer capability to tilt, pan, and zoom using joysticks. Our device will be set apart from the competition by its control mechanism; 3d manipulation will occur through simple rotation of the entire device rather than manipulation of a button embedded into the device. This allows the user to manipulate the device without the need to use both hands or a platform to stabilize the controller.
